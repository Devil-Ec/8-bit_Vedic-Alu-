# 8-bit_Vedic-Alu-
This project details the design and implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) based on Vedic mathematics, utilizing Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The design was developed and simulated using Xilinx Vivado and subsequently implemented on a Spartan-7 FPGA via the Boolean board.

The ALU supports a range of arithmetic and logical operations, achieving enhanced computational efficiency through the incorporation of Vedic multiplication techniques. This work exemplifies the effective integration of ancient mathematical principles into contemporary digital hardware design, highlighting their relevance and applicability in modern electronic systems.
